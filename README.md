AI Automation System will deliver a scalable, intelligence-driven pipeline that automatically sources, filters, summarises, and posts high-value tech news, events, and study/career resources directly to DSEC's communication channels. This system will operate alongside the website and Discord bot, becoming a core infrastructure pillar for DSEC's long-term digital presence.
